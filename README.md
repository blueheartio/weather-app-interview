# Weather App

At startup the app shows some JSON pulled from a weather API. The api supports querying for two cities, london and sydney. Here are some tasks to complete, in whatever order you like:

- Render the JSON in a human readable format, but don't spend too much time on this - appearances are not important.
- Support switching between cities.
- Improve application type-safety.
- The `/sydney` endpoint is slow, so show the user something to let them know the app is doing something until the data is available.
- Add a ui element to show the highest temperature across all cities.
